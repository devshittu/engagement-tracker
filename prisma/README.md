Thanks for the correction on the SQL query—your version using `pg_class` and `pg_namespace` is indeed more precise, and it confirms RLS is disabled (`row_level_security: false`) for `users`, `departments`, and `roles`. However, the persistent 403 Forbidden error with `"permission denied for schema public"` suggests that the issue isn’t RLS but rather PostgreSQL schema-level permissions for the `authenticated` role used by Supabase’s PostgREST.

### Root Cause

- Even with RLS disabled, the `authenticated` role (used by Supabase for authenticated requests) lacks `USAGE` on the `public` schema or `SELECT` privileges on the tables. This is a deeper PostgreSQL permission issue, not an RLS problem.
- The `GET /auth/v1/user` succeeds because it’s handled by Supabase’s auth service, but the `GET /rest/v1/users` fails because PostgREST requires explicit schema and table permissions.

### Fix: Grant Schema and Table Permissions

Let’s explicitly grant the necessary permissions to the `authenticated` role.

#### SQL Commands

Run these in the Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Grant USAGE on the public schema to authenticated role
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO authenticated;

-- Grant SELECT on the specific tables
GRANT SELECT ON public.users TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT ON public.departments TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT ON public.roles TO authenticated;
```

- **Why**:
  - `USAGE` allows the `authenticated` role to access the `public` schema.
  - `SELECT` allows reading from the specified tables. Without these, PostgREST denies access, even with RLS off.

#### Verify Permissions

Check the current privileges:

```sql
SELECT grantee, privilege_type
FROM information_schema.table_privileges
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name IN ('users', 'departments', 'roles')
AND grantee = 'authenticated';
```

- **Expected Output** (after running the GRANTs):
  ```
  grantee      | privilege_type
  -------------+---------------
  authenticated | SELECT
  authenticated | SELECT
  authenticated | SELECT
  ```
- If empty, the GRANTs didn’t apply correctly—re-run them.

### Test Again

1. **Run the App**:

   - Local: `yarn dev`
   - Docker: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up`

2. **Login**:

   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/login`.
   - Use `superadmin@example.com` / `defaultPassword123!`.

3. **Check Network/Console**:
   - Look for the request:
     ```
     GET https://ihshdipfdefrhlinpxbt.supabase.co/rest/v1/users?select=id%2Cemail%2Cdepartments%28id%2Cname%29%2Croles%28id%2Cname%2Clevel%29&id=eq.b1254691-3c27-433e-9874-c2f8e5998385
     ```
   - Expect a 200 OK with the user profile data.

---

### Expected Console Output

- **Success**:
  ```
  Authenticated user: {id: 'b1254691-3c27-433e-9874-c2f8e5998385', ...}
  Fetched profile: {id: 'b1254691-3c27-433e-9874-c2f8e5998385', email: 'superadmin@example.com', departments: {id: 1, name: 'Psychology'}, roles: {id: 1, name: 'Super Admin', level: 10}}
  ```
- **Failure**: If 403 persists, we’ll need to dig into Supabase’s role configuration.

---

### If Still Failing

If the 403 remains:

1. **Check Schema Ownership**:

   ```sql
   SELECT table_name, table_schema, pg_catalog.obj_description(pg_class.oid, 'pg_class') AS owner
   FROM information_schema.tables
   JOIN pg_class ON pg_class.relname = table_name
   WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name IN ('users', 'departments', 'roles');
   ```

   - Should show `postgres` as the owner. If not:

     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE public.users OWNER TO postgres;
     ALTER TABLE public.departments OWNER TO postgres;
     ALTER TABLE public.roles OWNER TO postgres;
     ```

   - after seeds

     ```sql
     CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated read on users" ON public.users
       FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (true);
     CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated read on departments" ON public.departments
       FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (true);
     CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated read on roles" ON public.roles
       FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (true);
     ```

     and this:

     ```sql
     -- Grant USAGE on the public schema to authenticated role
     GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO authenticated;

     -- Grant SELECT on the specific tables
     GRANT SELECT ON public.users TO authenticated;
     GRANT SELECT ON public.departments TO authenticated;
     GRANT SELECT ON public.roles TO authenticated;
     ```

2. **Test with Anon Key**:

   - Use cURL with your anon key to bypass auth:
     ```bash
     curl -X GET "https://ihshdipfdefrhlinpxbt.supabase.co/rest/v1/users?select=id,email,departments(id,name),roles(id,name,level)&id=eq.b1254691-3c27-433e-9874-c2f8e5998385" \
     -H "apikey: YOUR_ANON_KEY"
     ```
   - If this works, the issue is specific to the `authenticated` role’s permissions.

3. **Reset Database**:
   - If all else fails, reset and re-seed:
     ```bash
     yarn db:reset:dev
     yarn prisma:seed:dev
     ```
   - Then reapply the GRANTs.

---

This should resolve the 403 by ensuring the `authenticated` role has the necessary permissions. Let me know the outcome!

     ```bash
     rm -rf prisma/migrations
     npx prisma migrate dev --name deploy
     ```
